## Our group at a glance  
We are a computational physics / theory of materials group. We study the structure and properties of 
different phases of matter and how they can be used in practical device applications. We employ theoretical 
models and computational tools that span multiple scales from the atomistic to the continuum. We also use 
machine learning methods to search for new or better materials, and for gaining a deeper understanding of 
complex solids and phenomena.


A recent focus of our research has been the physics of twisted bilayers and multilayers of two-dimensional 
van der Waals (vdW) solids like graphene, a topic for which we introduced the term “twistronics”. This 
denotes the extraordinary behavior of electrons in twisted few-layer vdW solids, where the introduction of a 
new length scale by the twist angle produces localization, correlations, and interesting many-body physics. 
Our group was part of the collaboration that demonstrated correlated electron behavior and superconductivity 
in twisted bilayer graphene.
